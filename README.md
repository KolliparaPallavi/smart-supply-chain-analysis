# smart-supply-chain-analysis
### Overview
This project performs a statistical analysis of the DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset with a focus on Australian orders. The goal is to understand factors influencing delivery performance and order financials. Key analyses include descriptive statistics, outlier detection, chi-square tests, and linear regression.
### Project Objectives
Examine the association between shipping modes and delivery status.<br>
Investigate the relationship between Benefit per Order and Order Item Total using linear regression.<br>
Summarize Order Item Total across Australian states and identify trends or outliers.<br>
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure consistency. 
### Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: DataCo Smart Supply Chain Dataset.
### Key Variables:

### Methodology
#### Data Preprocessing:
Filtered dataset to only include Australian orders.<br>
Standardized state names and converted delivery status to an ordered factor.<br>
Selected relevant columns for analysis.<br>
#### Descriptive Statistics & Visualization:
Computed summary statistics of Order Item Total grouped by state.<br>
Visualized data with boxplots and scatterplots to detect trends and outliers.
#### Chi-square Test:
Tested association between Shipping Mode and Delivery Status.
#### Linear Regression:
Explored the relationship between Benefit per Order and Order Item Total.<br>
Checked assumptions: linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, and influential points.
### Key Findings
No significant association between shipping mode and delivery status (Chi-square p = 0.9898). <br>
Positive but weak relationship between benefit per order and total order value (RÂ² = 0.0059). <br>
New South Wales had the highest average sales per customer (~$183.35). <br>
No major outliers detected in Order Item Total across states.
